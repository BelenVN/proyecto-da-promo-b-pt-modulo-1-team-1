## INTRODUCTION

This game is a creation that combines learning and fun, designed to challenge your skills while you immerse yourself in the Star Wars universe. Programmers can also enjoy themselves while developing their projects! <br>
Two versions have been developed: a simple one without a graphical interface and a more complete one with an interface.

## FILES

Files required for project review:
- **hangman.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the Hangman game and instructions for use.
- **README.md**: Documentation file providing an overview of the project.
- **logo_star_wars.png**: Logo image related to the Star Wars theme used in the game.

## REQUIREMENTS

To run the project, you will need the following:

1. Python (version 3.6 or higher).
2. Tkinter (usually included with Python installations).

If you do not have this librarie, you can install it using *pip install*.


## INSTRUCTIONS

For detailed instructions on how to run and play the game, please refer to the `hangman.ipynb` file.

Note on data entry:
In some runtime environments, it may happen that the program does not register user input on certain occasions, requiring pressing Enter a second time for the entered letter to be processed correctly.
This is a visual problem with the environment and does not affect the logic or operation of the code. If you experience this behavior, simply press Enter again without re-entering the letter.


## AUTHORS

This project originated as a collaborative effort between my colleagues and me, developed as part of the Data Analyst Bootcamp at Adalab. Since then, I have dedicated significant effort to transforming both the code and documentation, elevating the project to a more advanced and professional level.

### My Contributions:
#### Code Optimization:

- Completely restructured the program, organizing it into well-defined functions to improve clarity, flow, and maintainability.
- Implemented precise input validations to ensure a smooth and user-friendly gaming experience.

#### Enhanced Interactivity:

- Integrated thematic messages in Yoda's style, enriching the immersive experience within the Star Wars universe.
- Translated the original code into English, making it accessible to a global audience and aligning it with international standards.

#### Documentation Revamp:

- Crafted a brand-new README featuring an interactive table of contents for seamless navigation.
- Rewrote the introduction and presentation, highlighting the project's purpose and professional design.
- Added detailed sections such as Requirements and Instructions to guide users effectively.
